## National Electrical Energy Usage Prediction
*	Built supervised machine learning models to identify key predictors of electrical cooling demand using R.
*	Cleaned and preprocessed a U.S. commercial building energy dataset of 6.7k records across 50 states with 1.1k features.
*	Proposed Gradient Boosting as the optimal model with 36% improvement over the baseline model in terms of accuracy.
*	Characterized climate and building-type as the critical predictors of electrical cooling demand for devising effectual policies to enhance operation management of commercial building.

**Models used**: Generalized linear model, support vector machine, generalized additive model, Multivariate adaptive regression spline, classification and regression trees, bayesian additive regression trees, random forest
